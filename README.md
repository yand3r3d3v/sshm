**SSHM** is a TUI & CLI tool written in Rust to **manage and connect to SSH hosts, Docker containers, Incus instances, and Kubernetes pods** — all from one keyboard-driven interface.

Built for developers, sysadmins, pentesters, and homelab folks who live in a terminal.

## What's in the box

### Hosts (SSH)

- **Host management** — add, edit, delete, tag, organize into nested folders
- **Clone host** — `y` duplicates the selected host (tunnels included) and drops you straight into the editor
- **Fuzzy search + prefix filters** — `tag:prod host:10.* user:ubuntu`, fzf-style scoring
- **Tunnels** — saved per-host port forwards (local `-L`, remote `-R`, dynamic SOCKS `-D`); start them in the **background** and watch / stop them from the `t` dashboard
- **Multi-hop ProxyJump** — `bastion1,bastion2`, each entry resolves against your saved hosts automatically
- **Identity management** — push SSH public keys, generate new keys (`ed25519`, `ed25519-sk` FIDO2, `ecdsa`, `rsa`), load into `ssh-agent`
- **ForwardAgent (`-A`) per host** — opt-in with a visible warning, badged in the list
- **Mosh per host** — opt-in toggle; connects via `mosh` instead of `ssh`, forwarding port / identity / ProxyJump automatically
- **Per-host notes** — free-text reminder shown in the detail panel
- **Hardware key detection** — `[HW]` badge for `*-sk` keys
- **Frecency sort + Recently Used** — `s` cycles `name → MRU → most-used → favorites → frecency`
- **Group by tag** — `g` toggles between folder view and tag view
- **Bulk actions** — `Space` selects, `T` adds tags to selection, `D` deletes, `C` clears
- **Fan-out** — `X` runs one command on every selected host over SSH, with per-host output and an ok/failed summary
- **Quick connect** — `1`-`9` connects to the Nth visible host
- **Health probes** — periodic TCP + SSH banner check, latency in ms, banner version (`OpenSSH_9.6`) shown inline

### Kluster — Docker, Incus, k8s/k3s

A dedicated tab between **Hosts** and **Identities** to manage containers and pods:

- **Docker (local)** — auto-detected if `docker` is on PATH and the daemon is up
- **Docker (remote)** — pick any saved SSH host, sshm sets `DOCKER_HOST=ssh://...` and tunnels everything natively. No port to open, no TLS, no socket setup
- **Incus (local)** — auto-detected, lists containers and VMs
- **Incus (remote)** — auto-imported from `incus remote list`
- **Kubernetes / K3s** — auto-imported from every context in `~/.kube/config` and `$KUBECONFIG`
- **One Enter to shell** into any container / pod / instance — `/bin/sh` directly, no bash dance
- **One `l` to follow logs** — `Ctrl+C` returns to the TUI cleanly (no app exit)
- **Lifecycle control** — `s` starts/stops and `R` restarts Docker containers and Incus instances right from the list
- **Pod cleanup** — `d` on a `Succeeded`/`Failed` pod runs `kubectl delete pod`
- **Section folding** — clusters collapsed by default, `Enter` on a header toggles
- **Live filter** — `/` fuzzy-filters containers, pods and instances across every section (force-expands while filtering)
- **Live discovery** — background worker polls every `kluster_refresh_secs` (configurable in Settings)

### Quality of life

- **i18n** — UI strings translatable; English + French bundled. Pick via `SSHM_LANG=fr`
- **Themes** — fully customizable colors via `theme.toml`, with an optional transparent background that uses the terminal's own
- **Toast notifications** — non-intrusive feedback for actions
- **Desktop notifications** — native OS alerts (`notify-send` / `osascript`) when a background tunnel drops or a host changes reachability
- **Open in a new terminal** — `o` launches the SSH session in a separate terminal window (auto-detected, or set `external_terminal`)
- **Auto-export** — optionally writes a clean `~/.ssh/config` on every save
- **CLI mode** — scriptable commands for automation

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

```bash
brew tap Sn0wAlice/sshm https://github.com/Sn0wAlice/sshm
brew install sshm
```

### Download pre-built binary

Grab the latest binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/Sn0wAlice/sshm/releases/latest) page.

**Linux (amd64)**
```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/Sn0wAlice/sshm/releases/latest/download/sshm-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xz
sudo mv sshm /usr/local/bin/
```

**Linux (arm64)**
```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/Sn0wAlice/sshm/releases/latest/download/sshm-linux-arm64.tar.gz | tar xz
sudo mv sshm /usr/local/bin/
```

**macOS (Apple Silicon)**
```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/Sn0wAlice/sshm/releases/latest/download/sshm-darwin-arm64.tar.gz | tar xz
sudo mv sshm /usr/local/bin/
```

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sn0wAlice/sshm.git
cd sshm
cargo build --release
sudo cp target/release/sshm /usr/local/bin/
```

**Requirements:**
- Rust stable toolchain (build only)
- `ssh` client (always)
- `docker` CLI on PATH (for the Docker section of the Kluster tab — local *and* remote)
- `kubectl` on PATH (for k8s/k3s clusters)
- `incus` CLI on PATH (for Incus instances)
- A terminal with UTF-8 & ANSI support

The Kluster tab degrades gracefully — sections show `(unavailable)` when the corresponding CLI / daemon isn't reachable.

## Usage

### TUI (recommended)

```bash
sshm
```

The TUI has 6 tabs (`←` / `→` to switch):

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Hosts** | SSH host list with folders, tags, tunnels, identity management |
| **Kluster** | Docker / Incus / k8s containers and pods |
| **Identities** | Local SSH keys (`~/.ssh`), generate, push, load into agent |
| **Settings** | Defaults, health-check intervals, kluster refresh, etc. |
| **Theme** | Pick / customize TUI colors |
| **Help** | In-app help |

### Kluster Docker remote — quickstart

1. Add an SSH host in the **Hosts** tab pointing at a machine where Docker runs.
2. Make sure your SSH user is in the `docker` group on that host (`ssh user@host docker ps` should work).
3. In the **Kluster** tab, navigate to the `Docker (local)` header and press `n`.
4. Pick the host from the list. Done — sshm tunnels every `docker` call over SSH.

No ports opened, no TLS to set up, no `dockerd` socket exposed.

### CLI commands

```bash
sshm list [--filter "expr"]              # list hosts (filter: tag:foo host:1.* user:bar name:*xyz*)
sshm connect <name> [ssh-options...]     # connect to a host (alias: c)
sshm create                              # interactively create a host
sshm edit                                # edit an existing host
sshm delete                              # delete a host
sshm tag add <name> <tag1,tag2>          # add tags
sshm tag del <name> <tag1,tag2>          # remove tags
sshm load_local_conf                     # import hosts from ~/.ssh/config
sshm export [path]                       # export DB as ~/.ssh/config format
sshm add-identity <name?> [--pub key]    # push pubkey to authorized_keys
sshm help                                # full CLI reference
```

## Keyboard shortcuts

SSHM follows the vim philosophy across every list and form:

- **Lists** (Hosts, Identities, Kluster, Help, tunnel dashboards) use
  `j`/`k` for up / down, `gg`/`G` (or `Home`/`End`) for top / bottom, and
  `Ctrl+u`/`Ctrl+d` for half-page scroll where applicable.
- **Forms** (Settings, Theme, host editor, key-gen, cluster editor,
  folder rename, port-forward) open in **INSERT** mode (typing goes
  straight into the active field). Press `Esc` to enter **NORMAL** mode
  — there `j`/`k`/`gg`/`G` walk between fields and `i`/`a`/`Enter`
  switch back to **INSERT**. A second `Esc` (from **NORMAL**) closes
  popup modals; on the Settings / Theme tabs it just bounces back to
  **INSERT** (you switch tabs with `h`/`l`). The current mode is shown
  as an `INSERT` / `NORMAL` badge in the form title bar.

| `x` | Remove selected key from `ssh-agent` |
| `K` (Shift+k) | Clean a hostname from `~/.ssh/known_hosts` |
| `r` | Rescan `~/.ssh` |

## Configuration

### Files

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.config/sshm/host.json` | Hosts, folders, tunnels, ProxyJump |
| `~/.config/sshm/kluster.json` | Saved clusters + Incus remotes + Docker remotes |
| `~/.config/sshm/settings.toml` | Defaults, health & kluster intervals |
| `~/.config/sshm/theme.toml` | TUI color theme (optional) |
| `~/.config/sshm/tunnels/<pid>.json` | Live background tunnels per running instance — used to clean up after a crash |

### Settings

The Settings tab (`Tab → Settings`) exposes:

- **Default Port** / **Default Username** / **Default Identity File** — used when creating new hosts
- **Export Path** — where to write the auto-exported `~/.ssh/config` (empty = disabled)
- **Auto Health Check** — toggle the background SSH probe
- **Health Refresh / Cache TTL** — seconds between probe rounds
- **Probe Connect Timeout** — TCP connect timeout in ms (banner read uses ~1/3)
- **Kluster Refresh Interval** — seconds between Docker / kubectl / Incus refreshes
- **Kluster Log Tail** — default `--tail N` for `l` (logs)
- **Desktop notifications** — toggle native OS alerts (tunnel dropped, host up/down)

The Settings tab groups these into labelled sections (Defaults, Export, Health checks, Kluster, Notifications).

All values are live: hit Save and the background workers pick up the new TTL on the next tick.

**`external_terminal`** — a `settings.toml`-only key (not shown in the Settings tab). It's the command prefix used by the `o` hotkey to open a session in a new terminal window; the SSH command is appended to it. Leave it empty to auto-detect (`wezterm`, `kitty`, `alacritty`, `gnome-terminal`, `konsole`, `xterm`, or `Terminal.app` on macOS). Examples:

```toml
external_terminal = "kitty -e"
external_terminal = "wezterm start --"
external_terminal = "gnome-terminal --"
```

**`notification_icon`** — another `settings.toml`-only key: a path (`~` allowed) to a custom icon for desktop notifications.

```toml
notification_icon = "~/.config/sshm/icon.png"
```

On **Linux** it's passed straight to `notify-send -i`. On **macOS** the default `osascript` notification *cannot* override its icon (it's always osascript's) — install [`terminal-notifier`](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier) (`brew install terminal-notifier`) and SSHM will use it automatically to honour the custom icon.

### Theme example

```toml
bg = "#1e1e2e"
fg = "#cdd6f4"
accent = "#89b4fa"
muted = "#6c7086"
error = "#f38ba8"
success = "#a6e3a1"
transparent_bg = false
```

Set `transparent_bg = true` (or tick **Transparent background** in the Theme
tab) to drop the `bg` colour entirely and let your terminal's own background —
including any transparency / blur — show through. The `bg` hex is kept on disk
so unticking the box restores it.

### Localization

```bash
SSHM_LANG=fr sshm     # French
SSHM_LANG=en sshm     # English (default)
```

Falls back to the value of `LC_ALL` / `LANG` if `SSHM_LANG` is unset. Unknown locales fall back to English silently.

## Contributing

PRs welcome — especially for:
- Terminal UX polish
- New runtime backends (LXD, Podman, ...)
- Platform support (Windows is currently best-effort)
- More translations (just drop a `src/locales/<code>.toml`)

Run `cargo test` before sending a PR — the suite covers parsers (filter, kubeconfig, ssh_config, JSON migrations) and a handful of pure logic units (frecency, ssh banner, ProxyJump resolver, etc.).
